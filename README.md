# ACF YouTube Uploader Field (WordPress Plugin)

__ACF YouTube Uploader Field__ is a WordPress plugin that allows you to upload videos directly to YouTube via API from the WordPress admin area and select existing videos on your YouTube channel based on playlists. It is particularly useful for managing videos that may be associated with Custom Post Types (CPT).

To use this plugin, you need to configure Google oAuth credentials so the plugin can authenticate with the user's YouTube channel.

## Requirements

- PHP ^8.0
- WordPress ^5.7 || ^6.0
- [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com) ^5.9 || ^6.0

## Features

- direct video upload to YouTube from CPTs within the WordPress interface
- selection of existing YouTube videos, filtered by playlists
- support for "unlisted" video privacy, making this plugin ideal for managing private or exclusive videos tied to specific content
- support for logging with [Wonolog](https://github.com/inpsyde/Wonolog) ^2.x, if available
- use official [ACF Example Field Type](https://github.com/AdvancedCustomFields/acf-example-field-type)
- made with [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com) (no jQuery)
- autoload classes with Composer and PSR-4
- support ACF nested repeater
- translations managed via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/acf-youtube-uploader-field)

define('FRUGAN_AYUF_CACHE_BUSTING_ENABLED', true);
```
